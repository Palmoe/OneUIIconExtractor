Since One UI 8.5, a beautiful 3D shadow effect has been added to all app icons, and Samsung's default and system app icons are specifically designed to incorporate this detail.<br>
However, most app icon extraction tools fail to capture this shadow effect. Unfortunately, this means that icons extracted and distributed by users, or those found on various wikis, often lack this visual element.

To properly extract icons with this effect intact, you must use the `semGetApplicationIconForIconTray(...)` or `semGetActivityIconForIconTray(...)` methods, which operate exclusively on Samsung devices.<br>
This was discovered by reverse engineering One UI Home, and One UI Icon Extractor utilizes these exact methods. (Note: The 3D effect is not applied to certain activities, which appears to be either an intended behavior of One UI or a bug.)

While this app also works on non-Samsung Android devices, it will fall back to using standard Android APIs in those environments.

## Installation
You can download the app from the GitHub Releases page.<br>

## Pro Tip
If you want to apply the One UI Sans font to your own app, declare the `sec` font family before `sans-serif`.
